# Tennis Serve

The tennis serve is one of the most important skills in tennis. Why?

# What Makes a Great Server?


&lt;h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;I think it was all about him being able to get free points on his serve. Heâ€™s a top 10 player and in these decisive moments he could get some free points toward the end of the match.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&amp;mdash;Alex De Minaur on playing Alexander Zverev at Davis Cup 2018&lt;/h3&gt;

# Point Level Tennis Data

The `deuce` package is a helpful resource for match, point, and shot-level data about tennis.

It is available for download on github.


```r
library(devtools)

install_github('skoval/deuce')
```

---

# Free Point Data

The data set `gs_point_by_point` has point level data for men's and women's Grand Slams from 2011-2017. 

- Every row corresponds to one point in a Grand Slam match

- For 2017, all matches include a `RallyCount`, which we can use to derive an indicator for a free point on serve

---

# Problem: Preparing Data

Using the `gs_point_by_point` data...

1. Limit the dataset to 2017 men's matches

2. Derive free point, server, and receiver variables

3. Select the matchid, server, receiver, free point, and serve number variables

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Hint: A free point is a point won by the server with an ace or service winner

---

# Solution


```r
library(deuce)

data(gs_point_by_point)

men2017 &lt;- gs_point_by_point %&gt;%
  filter(Tour == "atp", year == 2017) %&gt;%
  dplyr::mutate(
    server = ifelse(PointServer == 1, player1, player2),
    receiver = ifelse(PointServer == 1, player2, player1),
    server_won = PointServer == PointWinner,
		free_point = RallyCount &lt;= 1 &amp; server_won &amp; 
		    P1UnfErr == 0 &amp; P2UnfErr == 0
  ) %&gt;%
select(match_id, server, receiver, free_point, number = ServeNumber)
```

---

# Problem

1. Summarize the number and percentage of free points won for each server and match

2. Where serve number is 0, assign this to a first serve

3. Summarize separately for first and second serve

4. Retain the name of the receiver in your dataset

5. Plot the distribution of free point percentage by serve number

---

# Solution


```r
free_point &lt;- men2017 %&gt;%
  dplyr::mutate(
    number = ifelse(number == 0, 1, number)
  ) %&gt;%
  group_by(match_id, server, number) %&gt;%
  dplyr::summarise(
    opponent = receiver[1],
    n = n(),
    total = sum(free_point),
    p = mean(free_point)
  )
```

# Modelling Free Points

A reasonable model for the free point outcomes treat free points as draws from a Binomial distribution with `\(n\)` trials and success probability `\(p\)`.

&lt;br&gt;

$$
Free Points \sim Binomial(p, n)
$$

&lt;br&gt;

--

But what determines `\(p\)`?

---

# Modelling Free Points

From our exploratory graphs, the minimum variables that could influence the proportion of free points are:

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

- The server's serve ability

- The opponent's return ability

- The serve number

---

# Regression Model 

We will consider the following logistic regression model for the free point success proportion on first serve:

&lt;br&gt;

$$
logit(p_{ij}) | First Serve = \mu + \alpha_i - \beta_j 
$$

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

- `\(\mu\)` Average free point percentage

- `\(\alpha_i\)` Ability of the server

- `\(\beta_j\)` Ability of the receiver


---

# Problem: Prepare Data

- Limit the dataset to first serves

- Include serves with more than 1 match

- Reserve some data for testing the model forecasts

---

# Solution: Prepare Data



```r
# Limit to first serve
free_point &lt;- free_point %&gt;% filter(number == 1)

# Limit to servers with multiple matches
free_point &lt;- free_point %&gt;%
    group_by(server) %&gt;%
    dplyr::mutate(
      matches = n_distinct(match_id)
    ) %&gt;%
    filter(matches &gt; 1)

# Assign test cases
free_point &lt;- free_point[sample(1:nrow(free_point)),]

free_point &lt;- free_point %&gt;%
    group_by(server) %&gt;%
    dplyr::mutate(
      test = c(1, rep(0, n() - 1))      
    )
```


---

# Solution: Continued...


```r
free_point$j &lt;- (1:n_distinct(free_point$server))[factor(free_point$server)]

free_point$k &lt;- (1:n_distinct(free_point$opponent))[factor(free_point$opponent)]

# Train data
trainData &lt;- free_point %&gt;% filter(test == 0)
```

---

# Bayesian Model

We have proposed a hierarchical model with server and receiver effects. This can be most readily implemented using a Bayesian multi-level model. Here are the distributional assumptions for our model:

`$$\mu \sim N(\mu_0, \sigma_0^2)$$`

`$$\alpha_i \sim N(0, \sigma_\alpha^2)$$`
`$$\theta_i \sim N(0, \sigma_\theta^2)$$`
All hyper-parameters will be given flat priors.

# Implementing in `rjags`



```r

modelString = "
  model{

    for(i in 1:N) {   
      total[i] ~ dbinom(p[i], n[i])
	  
      logit(p[i]) &lt;- mu + alpha[j[i]] - theta[k[i]]
      }
      
     for(l in 1:J){
      alpha[l] ~ dnorm(0, tau.sigma.alpha)
     }
	
     for(l in 1:K){
      theta[l] ~ dnorm(0, tau.sigma.theta)
     }

    mu ~ dnorm(mu0, tau.sigma.mu)
    mu0 ~ dnorm(0, .001)

 	  tau.sigma.alpha &lt;- pow(sigma.alpha, -2)
 	  sigma.alpha ~ dunif(0, 100)

 	  tau.sigma.theta &lt;- pow(sigma.theta, -2)
 	  sigma.theta ~ dunif(0, 100)

  	tau.sigma.mu &lt;- pow(sigma.mu, -2)

# Problem: Player Parameters

1. Obtain the serve and return parameters using `coda.samples`

2. Calculate the posterior median for each player

3. Plot the serve parameter against return

4. Who are the strongest servers? Who are the strongest all-around?

# Solution: Player Posterior Parameters

# Solution: Player Posterior

# What About Testing?

- We can look at the validity of a method by collecting posterior predictions

- The predictions can be collected at the time we run our model

---

# Model with Testing

      total[i] ~ dbinom(p[i], n[i])

      logit(p[i]) &lt;- mu + alpha[j[i]] - theta[k[i]]
    }

  for(i in 1:M){

# Problem: Examine Accuracy

- Use the posterior predictions to calculate the residuals of the predictions against their actual values

- Plot a histogram of the results across all servers

- What do these suggest about the model performance?
