\textbf{\textcolor{Rblue}{Overview:}} \\

I am pleased you will be participating in the \emph{Statistical
  Models for Sport in R} tutorial. The tutorial will cover a number
of skills and statistical models that are common in sports
statistics and show how each can be implemented in
\textcolor{Rblue}{\bfseries R}. The workshop will introduce
participants to a range of
\textcolor{Rblue}{\bfseries R} packages and real sports examples will
be used throughout. It will be very hands-on! \\

After completing this workshop, participants will be able to gather
and clean public sports data more effectively, explore data with
graphics, and apply some common models used in sport. \\

A brief outline of the workshop is given below.

\textbf{\textcolor{Rblue}{Tutorial Outline:}} \\


\begin{itemize}
\item Web scraping
\item Sports models and real applications
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Bradley-Terry paired comparison models}. Application: Which team is the strongest in the  English Football Association League?
\item \emph{Pythagorean Theorem}. Application: How can we predict an NBA teams
expected wins for the season?
\item \emph{Generalized Additive Models}. Application: How can we model the strike zone from
baseball tracking data?
\item \emph{Forecasting}. Application: What is the chance that a tennis
serve will be a service winner?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\textcolor{Rblue}{Preparing:}} \\

Please bring a laptop with \textbf{\textcolor{Rblue}{R}} installed and
install the following libraries via CRAN: dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, rvest, jsonlite, stringr, mgcv, rjags,
BradleyTerry2, lubridate, pitchRx 

\vskip .5in

These additional libraries should be installed via github using
devtools:

\begin{itemize}
\item Rselenium (\url{https://github.com/ropensci/RSelenium})
\item deuce (\url{https://github.com/skoval/deuce})
\end{itemize}

There will also be part of the Web scraping material that will require
Docker, which you can install here: \url{https://docs.docker.com/install/}
